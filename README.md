**Up To Me Companion App**

Although the aim of the intevention is not to encourage people to disclose, the goal of the intervention is to ensure that participants know how to make safe disclosure choices and to be encouraged by experiences shared by peers in the intervention's group setting.

The companion app in this repo serves to monitor and corroborate outcomes of interest for the research study (IRB Approved STUDY003535).
